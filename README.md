> Creation of a ransomware for an exercice for the 2024 FIC

## How does it work ?

This ransomware has been built to work on Windows. 

First, it will make itself persistent by adding a key to the Windows registry. It will then discover all the files given a starting directory and encrypt them all. 
When the encryption is done, it will download a custom wallpaper and set it as the wallpaper of the computer to display the ransom message.
Finally, it will make a DNS request to warn the attacker that a new victim has been found.

## How to compile it ?

You will first need to install some dependencies, to do so run the following commands :

```sh
cd src
go get
```

Then, you can compile the ransomware by running the following command :

```sh
go build -ldflags "-s -w" .
```

## How to use it ?

You can run the ransomware by double clicking on it or simply running the following command :

```powershell
.\ase
```
There is a killswitch in the code, if you want to decrypt the files, you can run the following command :

```powershell
.\ase --decrypt
```
