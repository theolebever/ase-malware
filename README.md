> Creation of a ransomware for an exercice for the 2024 FIC

## Project Description

This ransomware is designed for Windows systems. Here's how it works:

1. It makes itself persistent by adding a key to the Windows registry.
2. It scans for and encrypts all files from a specified starting directory.
3. Upon completing the encryption process, it downloads a custom wallpaper and sets it as the computer's wallpaper to display a ransom message.
4. Finally, it sends a DNS request to notify the attacker that a new victim has been found.

Note: This software is for educational purposes only and is not intended for malicious use.
